# EmeliaFedora
Just my configuration files for Fedora stuff, makes Fedora much more enjoyable to use. 

My dnf config (dnf.conf) goes in /etc/dnf.
I've also got a script here to enable RPM Fusion, only dependency (as far as I know) is Bash. Beware, it does enable RPM Fusion's nonfree repo as well, so if you're not cool with that, either don't use this script, or just get rid of that part.

If you encounter bugs or any issues, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request, I'm happy to address any and all I come across. However, if you want to customize this script, please feel free to do so, just fork it and make it your own, don't try to contribute it back here. Suggestions are nice, but this is largely how I like my Fedora install, it's mostly for me, but I figure someone else might find this useful to either copy (which is cool, hope ya like it) or build off of it (also cool) for their own purposes.
